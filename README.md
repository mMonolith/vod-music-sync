This project provides the tools needed for a streamer to automatically log the music they play on Spotify during a live stream. The generated log file can then be used by a companion browser extension to sync music for VOD watchers.

Now also contains a working version of the browser extension and works best VODs on YouTube with no known desync issues.

The iframe can be hidden or made transparent.

When watching twitch.tv VODs, avoid dragging around or placing the YouTube pop-up window/tab. If music is desynced, refresh.

I'll pay to get the extension on the chrome web store before September ends.
